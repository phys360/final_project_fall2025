## Summary Paragraph

A Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma actuator operates by applying a high-voltage, high-frequency AC signal across two electrodes separated by a dielectric barrier. When the applied voltage reaches the breakdown threshold of air, a localized, non-thermal plasma is generated. The actuator’s asymmetric electrode configuration—one exposed and one buried—produces a net electrohydrodynamic (EHD) body force directed along the surface from the exposed electrode. Because the discharge is non-thermal, DBD actuators are energy-efficient and can safely operate at atmospheric pressure, making them attractive for flow control, propulsion, and surface treatment applications. However, in practical configurations, nearby conductive surfaces can alter the electric field distribution, charge accumulation, and resulting plasma behavior. To better understand these effects, this study employs numerical simulations to vary both the dielectric thickness and the size of the surrounding conductive box. The results will quantify how these parameters influence charge density, electric field strength, potential distribution, and overall actuator performance. In particular, increasing box size will help determine the distance at which conductive boundaries cease to affect the plasma region, while varying dielectric thickness will reveal trade-offs between breakdown voltage, power deposition, and plasma uniformity. The expected outcome is that thicker dielectrics reduce electric field intensity and plasma strength, while sufficiently large enclosures produce negligible influence beyond a critical dimension.

## Motivation / Background / Question 

* A DBD (dielectric barrier discharge) plasma actuator operates by applying a high-voltage, high-frequency AC signal across two electrodes separated by a dielectric barrier. The voltage reaches the breakdown threshold of air, partially ionizing it and creating a local cold (non-thermal) plasma. One electrode is exposed to the air while the other is embedded beneath the dielectric; this geometric asymmetry generates a net electrohydrodynamic (EHD) body force directed outward along the surface from the exposed electrode.

* Because the discharge is non-thermal, DBD actuators are energy-efficient and can operate safely at atmospheric pressure. Their combination of ionic wind generation and reactive plasma chemistry enables applications across multiple domains.

* In practice, plasma actuators are often enclosed or positioned near conductive surfaces, which can influence the electric field distribution, charge accumulation, and consequently the induced body force. Understanding how dielectric thickness and conductive enclosure size affect plasma generation and actuator efficiency is difficult to isolate experimentally, making computational modeling a crucial approach.

## Results: 

* Through numerical simulations, the study will systematically vary the dielectric thickness and the size of the surrounding conductive box to evaluate their effects on plasma characteristics—such as charge density, electric field strength, and potential distribution. * Increasing the box size will help determine the spatial extent at which the enclosure no longer influences the plasma region, while dielectric thickness variations will reveal the trade-off between breakdown voltage, power deposition, and actuator efficiency. 

* These results require a computational approach because of the complex coupling between electrostatics, plasma chemistry, and geometry-dependent boundary conditions that are not easily captured analytically.

## Summary / Questions

* This work aims to answer: How does dielectric thickness influence the plasma strength and uniformity of a DBD actuator? and At what enclosure size does the conductive boundary cease to affect plasma performance? 
* The expected outcome is that thicker dielectrics will reduce electric field strength and thus lower plasma intensity, while sufficiently large conductive boxes will have negligible influence beyond a critical dimension.

## Comments

The full model might be quite complex, so will be best to focus on a particular aspect; also keep in mind that this has to be explained to an audience in a brief amount of time. It is suitable for numerical computation. 

- what would a schematic of this look like with all the parameters that are being used?

- are you including the dispersion of the dielectric $\epsilon$?

- what is the exact geometry? Is this a 2D cut along the z-direction and x-direction, or do you include more dimensions?

- what are the important parameters and how are they chosen?

- what are the boundary conditions in this problem?

- how is the breakdown threshold of air determined or implemented?

- how can the problem be simplified further to make it more fitting for the class, distill the basics, and focus on the educational portion rather than the research portion?
