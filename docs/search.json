The intermediate step to reach that goal is a culminating experience to use the skills from this computational course and apply them to solving an interesting problem in the given time frame. Therefore, the final project builds a bridge from course work to research work. It can deepen our physical understanding by exploring topics of interest in greater depth. Importantly, the final project provides an opportunity to collaborate, interact and communicate physics. The end product will be an oral presentation and a written report."

    "text": "In this project I will attempt to simulate a gravitational wave chirp signal which is produced by two merging black holes. I can compare it to data from LIGOs detections to see how close my simulation is. Using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, I will model the inspiral phase using a Newtonian model with gravitational wave energy loss. I want to visualize the resulting waveform, spectrogram, and orbital motion.\nGravitational waves come from accelerating massive bodies, the binary black holes produce very strong and measurable signals. As they lose energy to radiation their orbits tighten and frequency increases creating the chirp. Because the system evolves nonlinearly I will need numerical integration to generate the waveform to compare with real data.\nMy expected results would include the simulated chirp waveform that increases in both amplitude and frequency also a spectrogram showing the time frequency evolution. And an orbital animation of the merging system to visualize what is happening.\nMy main question is “Can a simplified model produce the features of a real binary black hole chirp?” I expect the data to match somewhat, and there is comparable data available."

    "text": "Motivation / Background / Question\nFractal billiards is the most closely related field of study. Typically perfeclty elastic particles (billiards) are placed within a fractal, treating the points along it’s boundary as a rigid barrier. Assigning the billiards some mass, initial position, and initial speed, their kinematics are analyzed for patterns. As far as I am aware, no study has assigned the fractal itself a mass. I believe it may be interesting to see what kind of gravitational field arises from the fractal’s underlying pattern. It could be a trivial one, with the ‘center of mass’ as the center of a radial field, however when accounting for the varying density of a fractal set, I believe the resulting field could be non-trivial and thus give rise to interesting dynamics.\nThe definition of a fractal requires that it be an infinitely complex and self similar pattern, meaning one may never calculate a fractal to it’s ‘full’ extent. This means computationally, the fractal must be approximated to some finite degree which introduces a need for numerical methods."

According to a technical guide from GE HealthCare, this noise can come from fluorescent light, cell phoones, Bluetooth devices, or physical movement of a patient. A review by Luo & Johnston (2010) explains that ECG filtering is an essential preprocessing step. Noise can hide features like the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave. They also discuss how different types of noise require different filtering strategies, and how filtering must be done carefully to avoid the diagnostic information.\nThe Fourier transform is a common way to separate a signal into its frequency components. This can aid in removing noise such as 60 Hz power-line interference. Because an ECG consists of a lot of data points, and filtering involves modifying the whole frequency spectrum, a computational approach is a fitting practical method."

The voltage reaches the breakdown threshold of air, partially ionizing it and creating a local cold (non-thermal) plasma. One electrode is exposed to the air while the other is embedded beneath the dielectric; this geometric asymmetry generates a net electrohydrodynamic (EHD) body force directed outward along the surface from the exposed electrode.\nBecause the discharge is non-thermal, DBD actuators are energy-efficient and can operate safely at atmospheric pressure. Their combination of ionic wind generation and reactive plasma chemistry enables applications across multiple domains.\nIn practice, plasma actuators are often enclosed or positioned near conductive surfaces, which can influence the electric field distribution, charge accumulation, and consequently the induced body force.

Spacecraft accelerate gradually over time while being acting upon the gravitation influences of nearby bodies, in our case being the Sun and Earth, in turn preventing the perfect elliptical trajectories predicted by Hohmann transfers.\nDuring a continuous burn, thrust is pushing in one direction while gravity from Earth and the Sun is pulling in another, these two forces act at the same time continuous along with the change in the spacecraft’s velocity, preventing a simple analytical solution.\nHohmann transfers are used in orbital dynamics to calculate the most fuel efficient setups (the lowest needed \\(\\Delta V\\)) to move between two orbits while also being more simple to calculate. In real Mars transfer missions, Hohmann transfers serve as a baseline to plan missions initially but must be built upon to account for gravity losses during finite burns, planer changes requiring more \\(\\Delta V\\) and margins of safety given the likelihood of delays or errors within burns.\nTo do this, we will have to numerically integrate the Spacecraft’s position and velocity over time."

    "section": "Motivation",
    "text": "Motivation\nIt is commonly known by tennis players that topspin causes the ball to dip more quickly and land safely inside the court while backspin will likely keep the ball floating in the air and out of the court boundary. A computational approach is needed to integrate the equations of motion and demonstrate the movement of the tennis ball. The equations of motion with relation to drag and the Magnus force are complex and nonlinear. Through simulating the ball’s motion with numerical integration in python, I can analyze different parameters such as different spins, speed and angles to generate precise trajectories. This can possibly be done using Euler methods of integration.\n##Results\nThe computation will answer the questions about using different spin rates and how it changes it trajectory. Through numerically solving differential equations for position and velocity, I will be able to visualize and distinguish differences between topspin, backspin and no spin shots. The model will show how high the ball goes above a normal tennis net, how far it travels before landing and how quickly it curves downward. These results will consist of how air drag and gravity depend on velocity magnitude, range and direction. I expect the simulation to show that topspin creates an evidently faster downward curvature, while backspin creates a longer and slower path. The graphs that will be included will be trajectory vs time, landing position and velocity changes. These graphs will ultimately demonstrate the role of spin in shot control."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The project itself has two parts to the computational aspect when simulating the conditions of a drought. The first being that the amount of percipitation is defined and held constant for what would be considered as below average in the region. This region we wish to explore is the Oroville reservoir and the conversion from inches of rain into the water level unit of acre feet is found via getting the total catchment area and then multiply by the rainfall. Then from there, using one of the evaporation formulas, in this case, we plan on using the Dalton equation, we would choose what variable would be fluctuating to change the evaporation rate over a period of time. For example, using sympy, we would take the partial derivative in terms of humidity and then get the evaporation rates once setting the other variables constant and a changing humidity via an ODE equation. From there, we would get a list of evaporation results for the period of time we plan of calculating the period of the drought, in this case, 365 days with 365 evaporation results. After that, we would set the amount of water that the reservoir currently has at the start and set the constants. Then the formula of the Water Level = Amount Stored + Inflow - Outflow - Evaporation rates using all 365 days would be applied and finally graphed for the water level versus time. We could also get a graph of the evaporation rate per the changing variable.\nWhat is known in this field is the actual water levels that we can compare to for the span of time we wish to compare. The motivation behind doing this project is to see if we can predict the water levels in drought conditions as it is a very important issue that California faces. Due to wanting to see how the evaporation rate changes with respect to one changing variable, this approach requires a computational aspect.\nThe computational can answer questions about the reservoir as it predicts the amount of water that will remain with drought conditions. If the computational part also yields results that are similar to one reservoir, it can also be applied to dam or reservoir that is under construction and the worst case scenario if a drought persists as if there is too much outflow for usage that will result in the eventual loss of the water in the reservoir, this computational project could indicate it.\nThe specific question we wish to answer is the impact of the water levels in a changing evaporation rate. Subsequently, we can also take the evaporation formula and see how much it would affect the evaporation rate if another variable is changed and the impact of it on the reservoir. Or, removing the amount of inflow and outflow of the reservoir, we can see how much the changing evaporation rate affects the water levels by itself and theoretically calculate the time in which the water levels have a all dried up. As there is reservoir data available, we can compare our results and see if the results of this computational project"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The objective of the project is to determine the temperature profile laterally along a cylindrical tube furnace when specific parameters for conduction and radiation are given. There is an existing paper on this heat transfer model with plotted lateral temperature profiles that can used to reference for verification and validation. To simplify this to be easier to compute, there will be specific parameters defined for the dimensions of the tube furnace. There will also be some boundary conditions in place to make the temperature profile match more closely to the paper’s temperature plot such as having the walls (at a certain distance \\(x\\) and radius \\(r\\)) having a hotter temperature and the top and bottom surfaces of the tube furnace to be cooler. This way, the middle furnace section should be displayed as the hottest and the rest of the furnace would cool in a symmetric manner. With those parameters in mind, plotting the lateral temperature profile should fall into place as long as the correct numerical methods are chosen for the heat transfer (the paper mentions using trapezoidal rule).\nThis model and problem is meant to demonstrate the proper temperature that’s suitable for semiconductor crystal growth. The computational component comes from implementing the equations for conduction and radiation from the paper and plotting the temperature versus the lateral length of the tube furnace as distance x. It’s computational in how heat transfer is a partial differential equation type of phenomenon, which calls for iterative and numerical methods. This is particularly appealing to me because I am more used to seeing this problem through an engineering lens but hopefully with this physics project, I can gain more understanding to modelling this problem, as this is based off a real task that an established semiconductor fabrication company is undertaking.\nThe expected results should be some sort of temperature plot of the lateral temperature profile of the tube furnace. The total heat flux can be calculated from a differential equation on conduction that may be combined with a specific radiation equation. Please note that there may be some minor changes to simplify the model to be more doable. There is an equation to be looked at in the research paper being referenced for this design project but there is another conduction equation to be considered in the class textbook in chapter 14.\nThe question to be answered is what is the lateral temperature profile of the tube furnace based on the given parameters for conduction and radiation heat transfer involved. There is in fact comparable data that can be referenced from this paper on “Modelling Temperature Distribution in Cylindrical Crystal Growth Furnaces”. The data to be used in comparison is the middle curve in Figure 2a, where the chosen heat flux is \\(q = 0.1431 W/cm^2\\). In section a of Figure 2, the chosen dimensions of the tube furnace was \\(L = 20 cm\\) and \\(D = 2.5 cm\\). It’s to be expected that the middle section of the tube furnace be the hottest and the bottom and top ends as the coldest, making a parabolic shape as the temperature profile."

Well, I wanted to take what we know about our heliocentric solar system and see what it would take for 3 masses, including the moon, and how it would effect the Earth. Effect the Earth in the way of could it be feasible, how large would the masses have to be, or small, to keep a habital condition here on Earth. This would require a computational approach in more ways then one. It would take the basis of what we know about Newtonian mechanics, which we CAN solve analytically. This idea becomes interesting by that special component of adding a third body, this then turns our approach into a ‘coupled nonlinear differential equation’, which I am currently learning about in my numerical analysis class. Initial conditions would lead to chaotic behavior, and an analytical approach would simply, not be able to keep up.\nThis would require pulling my skill sets from past and present classes, including but not limited to; Computational Physics, Analytic Mechanics, Numerical Analysics, Differentional Equations A & B and others. In the extremely basic expectation, I expect larger masses to completely destroy this model, my end result existing in an simulation where Earth would not be habital, gravitational forces itself would not make this possible. I expect possible smaller masses to potentially make this model possible, however how small would be the real finding. More digging would have to be done to see if there was comparable data out there, that would either lead me to believe my findings were heading in the right direction or not."

    "text": "Comments\nGreat concept, the question and scope needs to be sharpened at this moment. For example, what is “habitability”? Is that defined by temperature, distance, etc? What masses, initial positions and velocities will be probed. The phase space can get very large, since we have 3 bodies, it means 9 starting positions (assuming planets are in one plane). Maybe keep 1 body constant.\nWhat is stability? Sometimes it may orbit a few times, then a planet will go off. Sometimes, numerical precision limits the orbit.\nStart with a simple system, using realistic parameters, make sure that your numbers are not too small or too large.\nUse energy conservation to make sure that your computation is not running afoul of basic laws. (Issue with the Euler method).\nBest would be to change one parameter at a time, so need to choose which one? Starting position of the moon?"
